                            from adopting a dog.
                            Studies even show medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid

                            is important to make sure that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog

                            Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature. Puppies
                            should be nursed the first
                            two months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six months
                            years old. Their food intake
                            should be reduced to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally
                            reduced to one meal after
                            they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60
                            and 70 percent water. The
                            ASPCA says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss
                            can cause death, so make
                            sure you keep your pooch hydrated!

                            Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush
                            frequently to reduce the amount
                            of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely difficult to
                            remove. Check for insects
                            such as ticks and fleas, especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only
                            important to your dog’s
                            health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the
                            soap out, as any residual soap
                            can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh
                            soaps can cause allergic
                            reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size of
                            your dog, you need to be
                            cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one
                            hand under the chest and the
                            forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your
                            arms perpendicular to the
                            dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

                            You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that
                            are typically recommended.
                            Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus.
                            Others may be determined by
                            your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include
                            Bordetella bronchiseptica,
                            Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria.
